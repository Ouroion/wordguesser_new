This codebase originated as an assignment for a software engineering course wherein students would incrementally develop a ruby version of Wordguesser (Hangman) using BDD and TDD, then wrap it in a Sinatra web server.

In this DevOps course, we will use the completed solution to this assignment as a starting point in an exercise to containerize the app and add it to a CI/CD pipeline.
